## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Make sure you have a valid `.env` file with the required environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
   VITE_MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   SERVER_PORT=3001
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode

To run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This will:
- Start the frontend Vite server (usually on port 5173)
- Start the backend Express server (on port 3001)
- Show output from both servers in a single terminal with color coding

#### Running Separately

If you prefer to run the servers separately:

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:server
   ```

2. Start the frontend (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Authentication

The application authenticates users against a MongoDB database. You can log in using:

- **Vessel IMEI**: The 15-digit IMEI number of a registered vessel
- **Password**: The corresponding password in the MongoDB database

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment to Vercel. For detailed instructions, see [VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md](./VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md).

Quick steps:
